## What I've built so far

I've processed over **10,000 user predictions** with 40+ active users who keep coming back for more. The platform automatically calculates results and updates leaderboards without any manual work needed - it just works.

The administrative system lets me create new prediction markets for events, and everything from data import to results calculation happens automatically. Pretty neat for a biathlon prediction platform!

## League system

Create private leagues with friends or join public competitions. I track seasonal championships and have an achievement system that unlocks as you get better at predicting.

## How this works

The whole system runs automatically - no manual score updates or result calculations needed. I pull live data from biathlon APIs, process it through my market formulas, and update everything in real-time.
